					<p class="card-text lh-lg opacity-75">
						This is my first website that actually go live. It was a long story,
						back in 2019 when I bought a domain named
						<span class="link-primary">haniffridzun.com</span>
						and started learning HTML and CSS to develop my personal website. I
						was very excited, try to make it responsive to any screen size,
						design beautiful UI that will be a treat for the eyes. However, my
						website wasn't go live, not until this date.<br /><br />
						Back then, while researching on the project, I was distracted. I was
						exposed to too many shiny techs such as C#, R, DART, and their
						glorious paths, Game Dev, Data Analytics, Mobile Dev. They shine so
						bright that I made a leap, LOL. From one jump to another, I realized
						that I tried to learn too many things without sticking with a single
						path and did not really master it completely.<br /><br />
						So here my take. Stay consistent with a single path that we have
						chosen. Be committed to practice every day and make progress to
						finish the project. Acknowledge each progress we made each day as it
						will boost our confidence and self-assurance in our abilities.
